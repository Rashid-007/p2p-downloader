Instructions to run the FTPClient - FTPServer demo.

SERVER:

Run FTP Server:
	 java -jar ftpserver.jar <port>

CLIENT:

Run FTP Client:
	java -jar ftpclient.jar <server host> <server port>
	
You'll be asked for a username and password. 
These are for logging purposes and the current implementation does not provide any security, therefore use any word for username and for password

You'll now be able to execute only 3 commands in the following manner:

>dir
Will show the current directory files. Equivalent to LIST command

>get <filename>
Will attempt to download the specified filename. Equivalent to RETR command

>upload <filename>
Will attempt to upload the specified filename. Equivalent to STOR command

NOTES:

- The client and server use a separate connection for the RETR and the STOR commands
